# 3dprint_math
Examples of 3D printing mathematical surfaces using MatLAB

## Instructions for using these at the DePaul Univeristy Maker spaces (Library Maker Hub and Loop IRL)
1.  Start MatLab, likely using the University's [Virtual Lab](https://offices.depaul.edu/information-services/services/Software/Pages/Software-for-the-Virtual-Lab.aspx)
2.  Make sure you select a convenient directory as your "home directory", such as the Desktop.
3.  Download the files in this repository
4.  Run the program `3Dprint_cyl.m` to produce a MatLab surface mesh figure and and the output file `mysurface.stl` .
5.  Open Cura, and load mysurface.stl .  Adjust as necessary and then 3D print.
6.  You may change sizes, cutoffs, scalings, functions, etc in the MatLab code.  More examples to come (see below).

## Done so far:
* Plotting in cylindrical coordinates, with examples:
  1.  Gravitational potential well (Z = 1/R)
  2.  Screw (Z = Theta)
  3.  Vibrations of a circular drummead (Solutions to boundary value problem)

* A full documented example of a gravitational potential well with physics notes is available on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:561757/#files).*

## To do:
1.  Rectangular coordinates
2.  Spherical coordinates
3.  Lines using parametric curves

## Some cool examples might be:
1.  A knot
2.  Brachistochrone
3.  Hydrogen wave functions
4.  Molecular bonds (shared orbitals)
5.  Multipole potentials
6.  Worm-like chains
7.  Ramdomly generated mazes
8.  Steel ball simulation of mean free paths
